Assignment 3
 In the mentioned code I've attached two separate sketches that I've been working on.
 ● Codeofrecording the audio sound.
 ● Codeofadata representation mapping to a sound.
 I tried to capture audio using the microphone of my device and transform the accumulated live
 data into a data representation of particles mapping the amplitude of the audio that's being
 recorded. It would further develop with various colour changes as well as interesting animations
 and much more effective feedback visuals to show the user.
 Its main purpose would be to record a musical instrument and map the amplitude of the
 instrument into an interesting data representation using an animation.
 I'm in the process of combining the following two sketches to finalise my project which I would
 give the name “Melody Motion.” Additionally, I would consider having more functions, where the
 user could control and see how it would be if the amplitude gets higher or lower etc.
 Enjoy
